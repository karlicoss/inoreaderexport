Still WIP, proper readme will be supplied later

NOTE: you need Inoreader Pro (paid!) account to use the API

- set up the application on Inoreader website https://www.inoreader.com/#preferences-developer

  take note of
  - =app_id=
  - =app_key=
  - =redirect_uri=

  put these in the secrets file

- call =get_token=

  as a result you'll get a json token, put it in the secrets file

  : token = {
  :     'access_token': 'XXX',
  :     'expires_in': 86400,
  :     'token_type': 'bearer',
  :     'scope': ['read'],
  :     'refresh_token': 'XXXXXXXX',
  :     'expires_at': 1685219181.56797
  : }


  after that the token should get refresh automatically when you run the script (it only really needs =refresh_token=?)
