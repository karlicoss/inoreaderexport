Still WIP, proper readme will be supplied later

NOTE: you need Inoreader Pro (paid!) account to use the API

- set up the application on Inoreader website https://www.inoreader.com/#preferences-developer

  take note of
  - =app_id=
  - =app_key=
  - =redirect_uri=
  come up with a path to =token.json= file (it won't exist at first, will get initialized during the initial login)
  - =token_path=

  put these in the =secrets.py= file

  On the first export, call the tool with =--login= (in addition to =--secrets=!), it will give you the instructions to authorise the script for Inoreader data access

  After that you should be able to use the tool just by passing =--secrets=.
  The token should get refresh automatically when you run the script.
